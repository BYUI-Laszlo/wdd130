    <h2>Laci</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone! </br></br>
        You can call me Laci, it is short for László. I’m a convert. I joined the Church in 2014. </br>
        I’m from Budapest, Hungary. I work at a bank; I do cyber security in the colors of the bank security. </br>
        I really love to hang out with friends and loved ones, but sadly it is nightmare to coordinate these hangouts. </br>
        I’m shooting for Applied Technologies, I’m somewhere close to the end of my 2nd certificate. </br>
        My goal for this course is to figure out if I want to continue my studies with web development or not. And also, to have fun. </br>
        I’m looking forward to learn with you guys and girls. </br> </br>
        Laci

                <h2>Main parts of a PC</h2>
                <p>Main parts of a PC There are many parts of a computer that might be scary at first. When you look at an online store you can buy a monitor, a keyboard and a mouse, a printer or an entire sound system. Some of these are really important, but these are not the parts we are going to talk about here. We are going to pop open the case and take a quick look at what goes inside. It’s important to know that there are many variations of each component type, we are only going to address the main function of the part and how does it fit into the big picture.</p>

            <h2 id="notice">Computers are electronic devices, as you wouldn’t poke your toaster with a screwdriver while it’s plugged in, you should also always unplug your PC before opening it up. Be safe!</h2>
            <section class="comp_left">
                <h2>Motherboard</h2>
                <p>This is the base of everything. An integrated circle board where you are going to plug in every other component. You could say it is the computers central communications backbone. Usually, you can find some other parts already integrated (included) on your motherboard, like the part which is responsible four your audio systems or USB connectors where you can plug in your phone.</p>

                <h2>CPU (Central Processing Unit)</h2>
                <p>If I would like to simplify it, I would say that the CPU is the computer’s brain. Currently the fastest CPUs can perform 6 billion calculations per secund on one core. What is a core? You probably met with the term when you checked out your phone’s specs. Basically, if you have a 6-core processor it’s like if it had 6 brains glued together. The faster ones you can get now have around 24 cores, and there are other technologies increasing these calculation speeds even further.</p>

                <h2>PSU (Power Supply Unit)</h2>
                <p>This one is pretty straight forward. Your PC needs electricity to work however, there are a lot of small delicate parts that need lower voltages than what you get from you socket. Basically, the PSU transforms and distributes electricity in your computer. There are lower and higher performance PSUs. You can check your individual parts’ watt usage and simply add them up to get a pretty good idea on what kind of PSU performance you will need for your computer.</p>

                <h2>RAM (Random Access Memory)</h2>
                <p>The name might sound a little weird to you, it is based on how this part works. You could think about RAM as the computer’s short-term memory. Imagine having a huge unorganized library. It would take you a lot of time to find a specific book you are looking for. Now, let’s say that you found that book, read a chapter, but when you go to bed you put it on your nightstand instead of throwing it back in the huge unorganized library. So, next time when you wish to read the next chapter, all you have to do is reach out and pick it up instead of going through the whole library for it again. Obviously, there isn’t enough space to put all your books on your nightstand, but the ones that are there are in your immediate reach. Well, this is what the RAM is for in a nutshell. </p>

                <h2>Storage</h2>
                <p>If the RAM was the short-term memory than the storage is the long-term one. It takes significantly longer time to get data from there, but it also has a significantly greater space. This is where the computer stores all your data that you might need in the future but not working with currently. Also, unlike the RAM, your storage keeps the data after you turned off or restarted the PC.</p>

                <h2>Video card</h2>
                <p>This part is responsible for sending video signals to your monitor. Some video cards can be found integrated on motherboard, but these are really low-end low, low performance ones. These components have their own processors and RAM’s. It is almost like small computer inside your computer with a very specific role. If you are interested in PC Gaming or Video editing, you will need to get a dedicated video card. These parts can be pretty pricy, a high-end video card can cost more than a whole computer with less performance.</p>

            <h2>It is easy</h2>
            <p>Putting together a computer can be intimidating even if you don’t have to open up the case. There are many connectors on the backside, and even more cables. Don’t be embarrassed if you feel like there is a never-ending tangled cable-jungle behind your PC that you don’t even want to touch.</p>
           </section>
           <p>Now I will let you in on a little secret. Do you remember that child’s toy where you had different shapes like a cube, a sphere and so on and you had to place them into a box with matching shapes like a rectangle and a circle? I bet that you wouldn’t call that complicated and definitely wouldn’t scare you</p>

           <p>The backside of a PC is pretty similar in a way. The connectors have different sizes and shapes based on their function, so all you have to do is to take a good look at the end of the cables and pretty soon you will find the matching connectors on the back of the computer. </p>

           <p>Don’t let PC building scare you. If you get trough the first steps and start to see the connections between the certain parts and their function and parameters, you will start to enjoy it and you will get excited about the many possibilities.</p>

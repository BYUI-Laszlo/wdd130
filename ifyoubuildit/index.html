                <h2>Build your own PC</h2>
                <p>Building your own PC is way easier than you would think. The advancement of technology is unstoppable. These days you hold a greater computing power in your pocket than what every military power had on the whole world combined in the ‘60s. Your phone is more than 2000 times faster than the fastest supercomputer in 1985. So, it is easy to think of computers as some impossible-to-understand electronic magic machines. You might think building a computer from parts is a job for trained IT professionals. What would you say if I told you that anyone can do it. All you need is a basic understanding of the parts and their functions, the user manuals that come with the parts, maybe a few tutorial videos, just in case and a screwdriver. There are some great deals on pre-built PC-s out there, so why would you want to build your own? A really great question.</p>

                <h2>Here are a few pros:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Most of the pre-built computers have some great components in them, but also some weaker ones that you would never choose if you would build your own</li>
                    <li>It is the greatest way to get the best price per performance out of your machine.</li>
                    <li>You can future proof your PC by choosing components that are supported for a longer period of time, so in a few years you need to buy only a part or two to upgrade it, instead of buying a new computer.</li>
                    <li>You usually get better warranties on parts than what you would get on a pre-built configuration.</li>
                    <li> You don’t have to deal with a bunch of unnecessary applications (bloatware) on your fresh operating systems, you only get what you need, what you install.</li>
                    <li>You can use better quality parts, so you don’t have to deal with performance or overheating problems.</li>
                    <li>You can customize your PC with if you would like to, fancy casing, RGB lighting and more.</li>
                    <li>Bragging rights.</li>

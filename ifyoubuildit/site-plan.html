        Build your own PC
        Building your own PC is way easier than you would think. The advancement of technology is unstoppable. These days you hold a greater computing power in your pocket than what every military power had on the whole world combined in the ‘60s. Your phone is more than 2000 times faster than the fastest supercomputer in 1985. So, it is easy to think of computers as some impossible-to-understand electronic magic machines.  
        You might think building a computer from parts is a job for trained IT professionals. What would you say if I told you that anyone can do it. All you need is a basic understanding of the parts and their functions, the user manuals that come with the parts, maybe a few tutorial videos, just in case and a screwdriver.
        There are some great deals on pre-built PC-s out there, so why would you want to build your own? A really great question. Here are a few pros:
        •	Most of the pre-built computers have some great components in them, but also some weaker ones that you would never choose if you would build your own.
        •	It is the greatest way to get the best price per performance out of your machine.
        •	You can future proof your PC by choosing components that are supported for a longer period of time, so in a few years you need to buy only a part or two to upgrade it, instead of buying a new computer. 
        •	You usually get better warranties on parts than what you would get on a pre-built configuration. 
        •	You don’t have to deal with a bunch of unnecessary applications (bloatware) on your fresh operating systems, you only get what you need, what you install. 
        •	You can use better quality parts, so you don’t have to deal with performance or overheating problems.
        •	You can customize your PC with if you would like to, fancy casing, RGB lighting and more.
        •	Bragging rights.

      <h3>Components</h3>
      <p>
        Main parts of a PC
        There are many parts of a computer that might be scary at first. When you look at an online store you can buy a monitor, a keyboard and a mouse, a printer or an entire sound system. Some of these are really important, but these are not the parts we are going to talk about here. We are going to pop open the case and take a quick look at what goes inside. It’s important to know that there are many variations of each component type, we are only going to address the main function of the part and how does it fit into the big picture.
        Notice! Computers are electronic devices, as you wouldn’t poke your toaster with a screwdriver while it’s plugged in, you should also always unplug your PC before opening it up. Be safe!
        
        Motherboard
        This is the base of everything. An integrated circle board where you are going to plug in every other component. You could say it is the computers central communications backbone. Usually, you can find some other parts already integrated (included) on your motherboard, like the part which is responsible four your audio systems or USB connectors where you can plug in your phone.
        CPU (Central Processing Unit)
        If I would like to simplify it, I would say that the CPU is the computer’s brain. Currently the fastest CPUs can perform 6 billion calculations per secund on one core. What is a core? You probably met with the term when you checked out your phone’s specs. Basically, if you have a 6-core processor it’s like if it had 6 brains glued together. The faster ones you can get now have around 24 cores, and there are other technologies increasing these calculation speeds even further.
        PSU (Power Supply Unit)
        This one is pretty straight forward. Your PC needs electricity to work however, there are a lot of small delicate parts that need lower voltages than what you get from you socket. Basically, the PSU transforms and distributes electricity in your computer. There are lower and higher performance PSUs. You can check your individual parts’ watt usage and simply add them up to get a pretty good idea on what kind of PSU performance you will need for your computer.
        RAM (Random Access Memory)
        The name might sound a little weird to you, it is based on how this part works. You could think about RAM as the computer’s short-term memory. Imagine having a huge unorganized library. It would take you a lot of time to find a specific book you are looking for. Now, let’s say that you found that book, read a chapter, but when you go to bed you put it on your nightstand instead of throwing it back in the huge unorganized library. So, next time when you wish to read the next chapter, all you have to do is reach out and pick it up instead of going through the whole library for it again. Obviously, there isn’t enough space to put all your books on your nightstand, but the ones that are there are in your immediate reach. Well, this is what the RAM is for in a nutshell.
        Storage
        If the RAM was the short-term memory than the storage is the long-term one. It takes significantly longer time to get data from there, but it also has a significantly greater space. This is where the computer stores all your data that you might need in the future but not working with currently. Also, unlike the RAM, your storage keeps the data after you turned off or restarted the PC.
        Video card
        This part is responsible for sending video signals to your monitor. Some video cards can be found integrated on motherboard, but these are really low-end low, low performance ones. These components have their own processors and RAM’s. It is almost like small computer inside your computer with a very specific role. If you are interested in PC Gaming or Video editing, you will need to get a dedicated video card. These parts can be pretty pricy, a high-end video card can cost more than a whole computer with less performance.

      <h3>It's Easy</h3>
      <p>
        It is easy
        Putting together a computer can be intimidating even if you don’t have to open up the case. There are many connectors on the backside, and even more cables. Don’t feel embarrassed if you feel like there is a never-ending tangled cable-jungle behind your PC that you don’t even want to touch. It is perfectly normal to think that you might mess up something if you would dare to figure out what is going on behind your PC. Now I will let you in on a little secret. 
        Do you remember that child’s toy where you had different shapes like a cube, a sphere and so on and you had to place them into a box with matching shapes like a rectangle and a circle? I bet that you wouldn’t call that complicated and definitely wouldn’t scare you.
        
        The backside of a PC is pretty similar in a way. The connectors have different sizes and shapes based on their function, so all you have to do is to take a good look at the end of the cables and pretty soon you will find the matching connectors on the back of the computer. 
        
        Don’t let PC building scare you. If you get trough the first steps and start to see the connections between the certain parts and their function and parameters, you will start to enjoy it and you will get excited about the many possibilities.
